							<p>I am a driven second year student pursuing a combined major in business and computer science at the Sauder School of Business. This unique program, also known as BUCS for short, is an amalgam of business concepts and technical skill that allow me to thrive in both computer science and business environments.
								I possess the ability to motivate a team and critically think outside of the box, skills that have been developed in various leadership positions, relevant commerce and computer science courses, as well as team initiatives.

 <br><br>
Outside of school, my interests include exploring the world and immersing myself in diverse cultural settings in places such as Peru, Europe, and China.
Proficient in both English and Shanghainese, I am passionate about creating meaningful impact in the local, environmental, and social community.
I am always looking for opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or through email at deborahzhang15@gmail.com.

							<p>
								As a bridge between business and technology, I have a strong understanding of object-orientated programming, data structures, and algorithms exemplified through my

experiences developing Mind the Gap, an Android web-based application project done for a software construction class.

Mind the Gap was completed by debugging and testing algorithms using JUnit testing and ultimately included over 10,000

lines of Java and JavaScript code.</p>
							<p>I possess the ability to think critically in business and technical aspects, given my unique background in commerce and computer

science. My commerce background not only allows me to understand core business concepts found in finance, investing,

and accounting, but also allows me to flourish in a team environment. In contrast with my soft-skills, I am capable of thinking

logically and outside of the conventional box, as my competency stems from my computer science classes and from

building numerous academic and personal projects.</p>

<p> Outside of school, I am passionate about being involved in the community and strive towards creating meaningful impact for those around me. Some of my recent involvements include being a mentor for the BC Co-operative Association, as well as directing the finances and internal workings of UBCâ€™s Commerce Undergraduate Society Sustainability program amongst others.
My personal interests include keeping up with topics such as environmentalism, web development, and fashion blogging. Some of my favourite past times are painting, snowboarding, playing Tetris, playing the piano, and photography.
